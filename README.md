# ABL_Model
It contains the developed solvers, turbulence models, functions, etc. based on OpenFOAM to simulate air flow over the small water surfaces. 

A 3-D numerical method is developed to study the airflow from land to water surface to investigate the spatial distribution of surface fluxes over heteroge-neous surfaces in (semi-)arid regions. Changes in the momentum roughness and thermal or moisture roughness lengths from land to water surface can affect the turbulent flow in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL). Quantifying these effects on the airflow and fluxes in the ABL is important for water resources management and local climate studies. To take into account the effects of atmospheric stability conditions on airflow and buoyancy force, the governing equations and turbulence models are modified to include these effects on the airflow. The turbulent airflow in ABL is simulated based on the
solution of the Unsteady Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes (URANS) method to understand the air flow over the non-homogeneous surfaces from dry land through the water surface and vice versa. A model has been developed that is flexible in solving the abrupt changes in all parameters based on surface characteristics e.g. changes in roughness, temperature and wetness. This
ABL model was validated using a range of different test cases extracted from numerical simulations in literature that cover a wide range of complexities.
The results show that the developed model can be used to study airflow and improves the prediction of the flow characteristics of neutral and non-neutral ABL flow over complex and non-homogeneous surfaces (terrain). The results of the model could be used to investigate the flow parameters and (heat) flux variations over small water surfaces considering its surrounding conditions.
